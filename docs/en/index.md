# Copilot & Co Tutorial

## What About AI Coding Assistants Based on Generative AI?

***Disclaimer***: *This tutorial introduces a few use cases of AI coding assistants powered by generative AI. It also highlights their benefits, such as boosting productivity and improving development practices, while pointing out their limitations.*

*GitHub Copilot, originally designed for students using the [GitHub Education offer][githubEducationLink], is used here as an example. However, you can follow this tutorial with other AI coding assistants like [Codeium][codeiumLink], [Cursor][cursorLink], [Supermaven](https://supermaven.com/) or [Tabnine][tabnineLink], which offer similar features. We'll use the term **AI coding assistant** throughout the tutorial.*

In this tutorial, you will learn how to:

* **[Installation the GitHub Copilot AI coding assistant][Installation]**
* **[1. Getting Started with the AI Coding Assistant][part_1]**
* **[2. Assisting with the Implementation of New Business Rules in a Simple Legacy Project][part_2]**
* **[3. Assisting with Working on Complex Legacy Project][part_3]**

You will also find some [Useful Resources][Resources] that were consulted while writing this tutorial.

This tutorial comes with a form. Feel free to [fill out this form](https://forms.gle/YquLZ7CMsmmgvwHUA) as you go through the tutorial.

To get started, go to the [Installation][Installation] if you need to set up GitHub Copilot in your favorite IDE.
If it's already installed, you can begin directly with [Getting Started with the assistant][part_2] using your preferred AI coding assistant.

## About Pedagogical Stratégies

This tutorial is designed to help students develop both their technical skills and critical thinking when working with an AI coding assistant. It offers an opportunity to explore, reflect, and grow through the use of AI.

The learning process follows three main steps:

1. **Experiment**  
Explore and test the assistant by following the guided tutorial. Observe its behavior, discover its capabilities… and recognize its limitations.

2. **Analyze** *the AI-generated code*  
Take a step back using a reflective questionnaire. Think about what worked, what didn't, and why. Use your own expertise to interpret the assistant's suggestions.

3. **Adjust** *the AI's suggestions*  
Refine your prompts, correct errors, and make informed decisions. This is where you exercise your own judgment and take ownership of your learning process.

This approach is guided by three key principles:
a **progressive integration of the tool**, a **critical validation of its outputs**, and a **fostered autonomy** through adjusting suggestions, reflecting on decisions, and learning to use AI tools thoughtfully and effectively.

## Research Publication

This educational experience led to a research paper presented at [ITiCSE 2025](https://iticse.acm.org/2025) :  
**[Developing Critical Thinking with AI Coding Assistants: An Educational Experience Focusing on Testing and Legacy Code](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3724363.3729050)**.
