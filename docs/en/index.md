## What About AI Coding Assistants Based on Generative AI?

***Disclaimer***: *This tutorial introduces a few use cases of AI coding assistants powered by generative AI. It also highlights their benefits, such as boosting productivity and improving development practices, while pointing out their limitations.*

*GitHub Copilot, originally designed for students using the [GitHub Education offer][githubEducationLink], is used here as an example. However, you can follow this tutorial with other AI coding assistants like [Codeium][codeiumLink], [Cursor][cursorLink], [Supermaven](https://supermaven.com/) or [Tabnine][tabnineLink], which offer similar features. We’ll use the term **AI coding assistant** throughout the tutorial.*
